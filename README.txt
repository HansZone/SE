We use the WampServer as our website-building tool, and it contains Apache, Phpmyadmin(MySQL) and PHP.

Here are the instructions of how to use it:

1. Build a new database named with "seteam" in Phpmyadmin; 

2. Import the stockDB.sql into the "seteam" database;

3. Put the php files exactly under the "www" sub-folder of the WamperServer root folder; 

4. Copy "localhost/updateCurrent.php" to collect realtime stock information;

5. Copy "localhost/updateHistorical.php" to collect historical stock information.
